# Build

Project build directory. This is where the `premake4.lua` file and generated project setups reside. You'll need orx's version of `premake4.exe` in order to run it. If you clone the official orx repository, it comes with the executable. It can be found in the `extern` folder after you've run the setup script.

By default it makes quite a few assumptions about project configuration (such as language, paths, output names, etc.). To make changing these things easier, I've added a file named `project.lua` that can be modified instead of `premake4.lua`. These variables are documented in comments.

### IMPORTANT 

If you add files to `src` or `include` after running premake, ensure they are added as part of your solution. You can do this by hand, but I prefer to simply run premake again. This does mean any changes you made to the solution/project configurations that were generated by premake will be lost. Since I personally don't have any desire to modify project/solution settings and prefer to keep that kind of stuff in the premake file, my Makefile has `sbuild` and `sclean` to rebuild the solution files.
