# Build

Project build directory. This is where the `premake4.lua` file and generated project setups reside.

By default the premake file assumes the project is a C++ project and puts built binaries in the `bin` folder. You can change both of these by modifying the premake file.

#### Note: If you add files to `src` or `include` after running premake, ensure they are added as part of your solution. You can do this by hand, but I prefer to simply run premake again. This does mean any changes you made to the project files that were generated by premake will be lost. This is why my Makefile has `sbuild` and `sclean` commands.
