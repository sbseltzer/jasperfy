# Orx Template Project

This project is a template that I'm developing as I follow the orx tutorial series. It reflects an evolution of my development preferences. Perhaps you'll like it and adapt it to your own needs. If you think there's a way to improve this template don't hesitate to add an issue for it or submit a pull request! My goal is to make this flexible and easy to adapt.

# Usage

Each directory contains, at the very least, a `README.md` file to explain its purpose and any important details to be aware of.

## File Locations

I use orx's bootstrap registration to add a the base directory of this project as a default search path for config files. I do this because I prefer keeping versioned game content (such as config files) outside of the bin folder. By default the built executable name is `Game.exe`, hence a `Game.ini` in the base directory of this project. 

If you don't like your executable/config file to be named `Game`, simply edit the `build/premake4.lua` file. It's as easy as editing a variable at the top of the file.

You can also move the `.ini` file to the bin directory and it will still work. At the time of writing this, if a matching `.ini` exists in both the base directory and next to the executable, the one next to the executable will be chosen.

## Notes on .gitignore and .hgignore

I've set this project up to ignore premake-generated files in the `build` folder, non-config files in the `bin` folder, everything but the readme in the `lib` folder, and the `include/orx` folder.

## Project Setup

### Running Premake

Start by running the premake file in the build folder.

It uses a premake file that has been tweaked to my liking.

### Orx Libraries/Includes

Ensure orx's libaries and includes can be found during compilation.

There are 3 ways to tell this project how to find the orx libraries/includes.

1. Download or clone orx's source code repository and place it as a sibling directory to this one. Ensure that `../orx/code/` is a valid path from this template project folder. Make sure you build the libraries so that the `../orx/code/lib` directory has content.
2. Put things wherever you want and define an environment variable called `ORX` that points to a folder that contains `include/` and `lib/`. In this case it's feasible to download prebuilts. For example, `export ORX=c:/custom/path/to/orx/code` or `export ORX=../my_orx_prebuilts/orx-nightly-2016-12-21/dev-vs2015-64`.
3. Manually copy and paste the relevant orx libraries to this project's `lib` folder, and copy orx's includes to this project's `include/orx` folder.

## Compiling

Typically you'd use the project files generated by premake to compile. This all depends on your OS and whether you specify a project type to generate.

### Makefile

Since I mostly use bash and plaintext editors for development, I use the premake file for project configuration. This means that anytime I add a file to `src` or `includes` I need to run premake again. 

The Makefile you see only exists to add commands that streamline that process on Windows. You're welcome to use whatever you like. 

If you want to use that Makefile, you'll need to modify your environment and install some programs. On Windows I use Git Bash for scripting and Visual Studio 2015 for its compiler. This Makefile assumes you are using a Visual Studio 2015 project config and have Git Bash, GNU Make, and MSBuild in your path.
