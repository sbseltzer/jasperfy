# Orx Template Project

## Usage

This project is a template project that I'm developing as I follow the orx tutorial series and reflects my development preferences.

It uses a premake file that has been tweaked to my liking.

Right now this is optimized for Windows development. I use Git Bash for scripting and Spacemacs for development. The Makefile at the root of this project exists for the Projectile layer to streamline development. It assumes you are using a Visual Studio 2015 project config and have Git Bash, GNU Make, and MSBuild in your system path.
