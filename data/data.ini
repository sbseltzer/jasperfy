; --- Objects ---

; Scene is the only object that is directly referenced in code.
; No direct interaction is made in code with it either: the code simply creates it and forgets about it.
; The only interaction made in code will be creating a random object (from the RandomList defined above) under the mouse cursor when the input "Action" is activated.
