# Include

This is where you put your include files. All `.h` and `.hpp` files in this directory will be added to the generated premake project. If you are going to be manually copying the orx includes into this project, create a folder called `orx` in this directory and put the orx include files in there.

See `build/README.md` for more detailed info about how this folder interacts with the build process.
