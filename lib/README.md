# Libraries

This is where libraries go for the linking phase. If you want specific versions of orx binaries to be used, place the compiled orx library files here.

#### Note: This is not where you put the dynamic link libraries (`.so`, `.dll`, `.dylib`, etc.) - put those in the `bin` folder or wherever you choose to put your game executable.
