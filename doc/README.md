# Documentation

Doxygen is an excellent tool for making your in-code documentation more accessible.

This folder houses all Doxygen-related content. Generated Doxygen output is placed as subfolders of this one.

It will only look for documentation in the `include` folder (excluding `include/orx`), the `src` folder, and the `doc/pages` folder. You can edit the `Doxygen` file if you'd like it to search elsewhere. 

All files named `README.md` are ignored by Doxygen by default.
