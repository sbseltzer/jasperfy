# Documentation

Doxygen is an excellent tool for making your in-code documentation more accessible.

This folder houses all Doxygen-related content. Generated Doxygen output is placed as subfolders of this one.

It will ignore the contents of the `include/orx` folder and this `README.md` file. You can add extra documentation pages by making extra markdown files in this folder. You can edit the `Doxygen` file if you'd like it to search elsewhere.
